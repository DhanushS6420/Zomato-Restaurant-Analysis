## Project Description
Zomato tasked us with analyzing their existing restaurant data to uncover opportunities for new restaurant openings. The project involved:

- Cleaning and preparing the raw data for analysis.
- Utilizing pivot tables for in-depth data exploration.
- Developing a dashboard to visualize findings.
- Providing strategic insights and recommendations for potential new restaurant locations.

## Data Cleaning
The initial dataset contained inconsistencies and missing values that required attention. The cleaning process included:

- **Duplicate Removal:** Identifying and removing duplicate records to ensure accuracy.
- **Handling Missing Data:** Filling or excluding missing values using appropriate methods like mean, median, or mode, depending on the context.
- **Standardization:** Ensuring consistency in data formats, such as dates, numbers, and categories.

## Analytical Approach
Once cleaned, the data was analyzed using Excel pivot tables, focusing on:

- **Geographical Analysis:** Evaluating restaurant distribution across different areas to pinpoint high and low-density zones.
- **Cuisine Analysis:** Understanding the popularity of various cuisines to gauge customer preferences.
- **Price Range Analysis:** Assessing average pricing to identify market segments.
- **Rating and Review Analysis:** Analyzing customer feedback to gauge restaurant performance and satisfaction levels.
